# What is liberal?

*The term 'liberalism' has to my mind at least two different sets of
connotations.*

**(a) as political epistemology**

Here liberalism (the philosophy of states like, say, the United
Kingdom) is the antidote to totalitarianism (Bolshevism, National
Socialism, Islamism etc...). Let me put it in form of a table.

|            | Liberalism           | Totalitarianism    |
|------------+----------------------+--------------------|
| primacy    | individual           | collective         |
| aspiration | freedom              | social engineering |
| method     | trial and error      | ideology           |
| attitude   | scepticism           | certitude          |
| preference | encourages democracy | shuns democracy    |
| strategy   | a step at a time     | grand design       |

**(b) as practical 'attitude'**

Here liberalism is a certain way of doing things – even ordinary
things. Let me put this too in form of a table.

|         | dynamic     | static      |              |
|---------+-------------+-------------+--------------|
| liberal | +look +leap | +look -leap | conservative |
| radical | -look +leap | -look -leap | orthodox     |

**Liberal** := look before you leap (go for change, but with
judgement). **Conservative** := look but better not leap (lest change
make matters worse). **Radical** := do not look(suspend judgement);
just leap (full of conviction). **Orthodox** := do not do either; (a
static world is better than a world unpredictable).

The over-arching quality here is:

> \+ scepticism + will = liberal  
> \+ scepticism – will = conservative  
> \- scepticism + will = radical  
> \- scepticism – will = orthodox
