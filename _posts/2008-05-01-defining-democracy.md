# On Defining Democracy

*What is a definition? What must it achieve? And what is it welcome to
achieve, but not obliged to?*

Looking at the matter modestly, a definition should be shorter than
any description of that what it is the definition of. And to be
shorter, it has to include some aspects of the subject at hand and
exclude others; usually, exclude most. If so, then the next obvious
question is: what *must* and what *may*. Sophists speak here of
*necessary* and *contingent*. Often, the choice is a question of
brevity and elegance.

One of the clearest illustrations here is, I think, Euclid's
geometry. It sets out with a short list of definitions (called
*axioms*: unproved) to construct a magnificent set of (proved)
conclusions from the axioms; these conclusions are called
theorems. Euclid's is one of mankind's greatest achievements.

But there is a serpent in this garden of Eden. With Euclid you can
master everything on earth – except the earth itself. The earth's
curved surface is not accessible to Euclid because its properties
contradict the theorem (inferred from definitions) on parallel
straight lines.

There are two ways of tackling this problem. (1) Throw out the said
theorem and save the rest. But in throwing one out we ruin it all. Or
else (2) we can leave Euclid as it is and construct a non-Euclidian
geometry precisely to answer Euclid's shortcoming (parallels
etc.). And this second method is now followed to deal with curved
spaces. And for everything else, Euclid continues to be the "ultimate
truth". Were we to extend Euclid to accommodate curvature, the entire
edifice would fall flat. In other words: we have here too a – happy –
instance of less being more.

Now to democracy. One essential question is how concise a definition
of *democracy* ought to be. Let me pick out two areas of great
significance:

1. **What happens between elections?**  
There are so many instances of democratic elections followed by
dictatorial usurpation of power, jettisoning of parliament, cancelling
of next elections etc. Democracy in other words does – obviously – not
imply its sustenance. But still I would rather go for a definition
(axiom) which ousts governments via free ballots – and does very
little else. The rest then would be left to follow as theorem from
this initial axiom. Democracy presupposes freedom but does not entail
(postsuppose) freedom's continued existence.

2. **What if there is very little to choose between contesting parties?**  
What if we are stranded between the devil and the deep blue sea?

To 1) and 2). Indeed, my *democracy* (actually it is not mine, it is
Popper's definition) does not deter our Hitlers and Honeckers, and so
many others not. Nor does it automatically solve the impasse between
the devil and the deep blue sea. Is my democracy then elegant but
useless? Well, I think not. The "free ballot" (axiom) saves the day, I
daresay. Freedom means individual and independent choice. And this
choice both anticipates and implies justice, press, parliament
(theorems). And out of free-flowing information emerges, always, a
further choice beyond the devil and the perilous sea. And this
coalition of individuality with freedom is precisely my definition of
(political) liberalism. In other words:

> free ballots <=> liberal democracy

Strictly speaking therefore, "liberal democracy" is a tautology. Some
surely come to power via free ballots; but a dictator to be worth his
name subsequently suspends ballots. To some, *liberal* belongs to the
axiom of *democracy*, to me, *liberal* is a vital theorem following
from that axiom.
