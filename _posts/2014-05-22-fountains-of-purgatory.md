# Fountains of Purgatory

*What India's present government ought - and: not - to do*

> Geography is the only constant in the affairs of states.

> States must not have friends; only interests.

Will Durant opens the section on India in his majestic *"The Story of
Civilization"* in eloquent despondency: 

> "But from Delhi to Ceylon the dominating fact in India is heat: heat
> that has weakened the physique, shortened the youth, and affected
> the quietist religion and philosophy of the inhabitants. The only
> relief from this heat is to **sit still, to do nothing, to desire
> nothing**; or in the summer months the monsoon wind may bring
> cooling moisture and fertilizing rain from the sea. **When the
> monsoon fails to blow, India starves, and dreams of Nirvana**."

This is fair signal at the forking of a passage to a more optimistic
tomorrow – away from lethargy, resignation, doom onto hope, courage
and well-being. To ever more freedom from hunger, insecurity and
stunting illiteracy, from sickness and the countless abuses of
executive, legislature, justice – in short, from this Durantian tale
of purgatory. Is there a shadow of deliverance beyond? Let us have a
look.

I shall multiply three factors of geography by three of what might be
called socio-political-economy to get nine "categorical
imperatives". The nine boxes are numbered. I shall to each say
something. The rather telegraphic than essayistic presentation is
deliberate.

|               | Military | Economic | Political |
|---------------+----------+----------+-----------|
| National      | 1        | 2        | 3         |
| Regional      | 4        | 5        | 6         |
| International | 7        | 8        | 9         |

**(1) National-Military**

(a) transform the police forces. If they are already a nauseating lump
beyond redemption as, so I am told, in places like West Bengal,
jettison them and introduce, say, special forces as replacement
(admittedly difficult in a federal republic).

(b) the thing is to ignore clarion – and hollow – calls for "respect
for the rule of law". Assure instead in every breast a keen fear of
"breaching the law".

(c) it is vital to metamorphose the police into a gritty buffer to
meddling by parliamentarian satraps.

**(2) National-Economic**

(a) India does not exactly face the dangers of "too much of market,
too little of state". Do away with governmental planning, abolish
planning commissions and sundry testimony to Mr. Nehru's
muddleheadedness.

(b) do away with stupid concoctions like "assured work for a hundred
days".

(c) act after the motto: as much privatization as possible, as little
state-intervention as necessary.

(d) free the Central Bank from the dictates of government. Instead let
it mainly (exclusively?) mind the money supply.

(e) privatize railways, steel production etc..; this might help in
curbing – not exterminating – corruption and raising efficiency.

(f) do away with the defunct infrastructure. Let a hundred motorways,
harbours, let electricity (including that from nuclear energy, both
on- and offshore) bloom.

(g) encourage the huge capital flow (cf. (f)) necessary, both domestic
and foreign, via, say, tax exemptions.

(h) urbanize. Build towns fresh and new. The gap between rural and
urban is still very wide (this could be a rare and happy case of
governmental deficit financing). And this in turn could balance out
the number of village dwellers.

(i) cut out the shocking maze of restrictions to exports and
imports. One could start with sacking the hideous bundle altogether
and after some trial and error reintroducing some.

(j) welcome foreign investment in all areas. End governmental
subsidies.

(k) never rescue bad banks with taxpayer's money. They should best
ameliorate in bankruptcy.

(l) so long growth is steady and assured, do not worry yourself to
death on 'overpopulation'. The invisible 'Darwinian' hand of ascending
well-being curbs those numbers.

(m) do not worry yourself to death, after a current fashion, on
"rising inequality" either. It is but automatic for inequality to rise
in times of epochal change, the heralding change nascent in the
emergence of information as decisive element in the economy. This
emergence obviously leaves behind a trail of underprivileged without
proper grasp of information. Once the emergence phase is over, this
discrepancy will gradually flatten out.

(n) To cut it short: education or its lack (cf. (m)) is the key – or
hurdle – to economic growth and to prodigal 'equality'.

**(3) National-Political**

(a) strengthen federal structures.

(b) consider a switch from majority- to proportional system at
elections, or a mix of the two.

(c) streamline the entire body of justice.

**(4) Regional-Military**

(a) looking at South Asia, India's geography will for ever be a source
of instability and conflict: the country wears a necklace of
uncertainties in Pakistan, Nepal, China, Bangladesh, Burma and
Ceylon. The same geography though might be of advantage
internationally (cf. 7b.).

(b) India and Pakistan mercifully share a rough parity in nuclear arms
and delivery systems. This not only makes any nuclear war extremely
improbable; it makes, as it were en passant, even conventional
skirmishes unlikely. Do ever be aware that power is assured so long it
is untested and deterrence is none as soon as it is tested.

(c) China is a much more severe headache. Start with water from the
Himalayas and end not with China's nuclear assistance to
Pakistan. There is a sliver of hope, though. This century will almost
certainly witness a Pacific war between China and the USA (cold?
lukewarm? hot?). Which means, China will seldom be in a position to
blackmail, threaten or belligerently confront India wholeheartedly.
Take this as cue for, say, subtle reverse blackmail vis-à-vis China.

(d) In case intrusions from Bangladesh are indeed massive (are they?),
fortify borders. No state is truly sovereign behind insecure borders.

**(5) Regional-Economic**

(a) China almost certainly will be eager to offer massive credits for
revamping India's moribund infrastructure. Go for that offer. None
else can supply the extraordinary amount of capital necessary. Utterly
ignore World Bank, IMF, UN and comparable saviours. At the same time,
never leave out a chance to flirt with all potential creditors
simultaneously.

(b) Pakistan and Bangladesh are in the mediate future natural,
borderless partners for India in trade and investment. Throw the
domestic market open to anybody willing.

(c) deepen relations to Pacific states, thereby countervailing Chinese
aspirations – not just military aspirations but economic as well.

(d) curb alacrity at every multilateral treaty, conference etc.. They
are mostly balderdash. The proper motto should be: as much bilaterally
as possible, as little amidst a crowd as necessary. If a set of
bilateral ventures should later meander into some multilateralism –
well then: the more the merrier.

**(6) Regional-Political**

(a) The tussle with Pakistan will probably turn friendlier once
theocratic fumbling and terrorist chaos in Pakistan have run short of
breath.

(b) Kashmir is an existential nuisance. And apparently shows every
promise of remaining so. Its affairs are volatile, enclosed as it is
in an unfriendly neighbourhood. And its populace, so I am told,
seeking to secede. If Kashmir is to be held on to, no amount of
autonomy and concessions will quench desires. Only firm suppression of
insurgency and non-infiltratable borders ultimately might. I for one
consider the possibility of Kashmir in the long run seceding not
frightfully low. But then: in the long run we are indeed all dead.
Keynes too.

**(7) International-Military**

(a) dependence on Russia for military technology is a mockery of
far-sight. Russia still is a backward country with a rotten
infrastructure, a fake democracy (admittedly, Mr. Putin rallies
considerable popular support), with sagging technology and a petrified
economy, all sitting upon a huge well of oil. Nearly everybody should
be welcome as partner in military hard- and software. China, USA,
Israel, Britain and else.  India's indigenous prowess is significant
too.

(b) India's landmass, tapering out at the Indian Ocean, offers a long
coastline and, hence, strategic advantages. But that requires
redoubtable harbours, submarines with medium-range ballistic missile
capability, fighter aircraft on large carriers and much else.

**(8) International-Economic**

(a) India is surely short of energy. Israel should be a candidate as
willing supplier of oil and liquified gas from its Mediterranean
fields. The snag is: how to transfer all that. Large container ships
are frustrated by the Suez Canal, circumnavigating Africa is
expensive, and laying pipelines to, say, the Persian Gulf from the
Mediterranean, technically and topographically easy, is politically
impossible now. Invest in wide research in fracking, taming the sun's
power, hydrogen fusion etc..

(b) Australia should not be left to prosper merely as China's
backyard. Japan might prove to be of use here in cooperative tapping
of that country's sizable resources.

(c) India, were it to forget either Africa or Latin America in trade
and investment, would surely suffer.

(d) if we ignore nature, nature definitely is not going to ignore
us. Look at the serious atmospheric health hazards in Chinese
cities. But here again, to quote Bert Brecht: first the feeding, only
then the morals.

**(9) International-Political**

(a) Seeking a fresh strategy, look East. Remember: the great Atlantic
millennium is ending. Europe will turn gradually irrelevant. America
is ever more poised on the Pacific. China, notwithstanding the
current and unique experiment in marrying a mellow totalitarianism to
a controlled-free economy, has chances of precisely therefore
ultimately imploding; otherwise it is of course the other eminent
address for India to forage.

(b) please note, Bismarckian and Metternichian balance of power is
most often better than vague institutions and note too that alliances
with two members are infinitely more efficient than with two hundred.

India's dynastic quasi-socialism, rapturously inept over generations,
offers a purgatorial choice: to hell or to paradise. In practice, one
never quite reaches either. But the path matters, and the answer to
the question "where to?" matters. Teleology in the affairs of states
is a waste of time. The road rather, is the goal.
